# CSP

This repo tracks my progress in [Advanced Placement](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/) [Project Lead the Way](https://www.pltw.org/) [Computer Science Principles](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-principles), the second class in the [Project Lead the Way Computer Science](https://www.pltw.org/our-programs/pltw-computer-science) classes.

This repo is roughly organized by unit:

-   ## [`art`](/art/) is unit 1

    -   [`turtles`](/art/turtles/) is lesson 1.1.
        -   [`115codefilesCSP`](/art/turtles/115codefilesCSP/) is a set of 3 python turtle programs which move a robot around a maze.
        -   [`art/turtles/project.py`](/art/turtles/project.py) is the lesson project.
    -   [`functions`](/art/functions/) is lesson 1.2.

-   ## [`web`](/web/) is unit 2

    -   `web/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## `data` is unit 3

    -   `data/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## `future` is unit 4

    -   `future/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## Other projects at the [root](/) are listed below

    -   [`bottom_line.py`](/bottom_line.py) was made for health. It's a simple python-powered CLI that determines if you have drunk enough water.
    -   [`complaint.py`](/compaint.py) was made for fun in [CSP](#art-is-unit-1). It's a python program which makes a `TurtleScreen()` that displays a custom message.
