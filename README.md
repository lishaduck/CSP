This repo tracks my progress in [Advanced Placement][ap] [Project Lead the Way][pltw] [Computer Science Principles][csp], the second class in the [Project Lead the Way Computer Science][pltw csp] classes.

This repo is roughly organized by unit:

-   ## [`art`](/csp/art/) is unit 1: Creative Computing for All

    -   [`turtles`][turtles folder] is lesson 1.1.
        -   [`115codefilesCSP`][115codefiles] is a set of 3 python turtle programs which move a robot around a maze.
        -   [`csp/art/turtles/project.py`][turtle project] is the lesson project.
    -   [`functions`][funcs] is lesson 1.2.

-   ## [`web`](/csp/web/) is unit 2

    -   `web/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## `data` is unit 3

    -   `data/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## `future` is unit 4

    -   `future/project.py` is the unit project.

-   ## Other projects at the [root](./) are listed below

    -   [`bottom_line.py`][bottom line] was made for health. It's a simple python-powered CLI that determines if you have drunk enough water.
    -   [`complaint.py`][complaint] was made for fun in [CSP][art]. It's a python program which makes a `TurtleScreen()` that displays a custom message.

To run tests, run `pytest`.
