# Setup

Detailed instruction can be found [here](https://github.com/lishaduck/CSP/wiki). However, below is a summary.

## Installation

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage our dependencies. We suggest launching [vscode](https://https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), creating a [venv](https://https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), installing [poetry](https://https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), and running `poetry install -G dev`.
